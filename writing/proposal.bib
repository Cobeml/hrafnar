	title = {{PRC} Concepts for {UAV} Swarms in Future Warfare},
	url = {https://www.cna.org/analyses/2025/07/prc-concepts-for-uav-swarms-in-future-warfare},
	abstract = {This report examines the People’s Republic of China’s ({PRC}’s) writings on the growing use of uncrewed aerial vehicles ({UAVs})—commonly called drones—in warfare. The {PRC} has been developing and testing uncrewed platforms since the 1960s but has largely lagged behind the world’s leading military powers technologically in uncrewed systems, particularly in autonomous and semi-autonomous drone swarm research. An examination and analysis of {PRC} writings from 2019 through 2024 indicates an intent to accelerate and advance the People’s Liberation Army’s ({PLA}’s) development, testing, and use of uncrewed systems, especially for drone swarm technology, in part because of the perceived threat from advancements in {US} drone capabilities. {PRC} writings suggest that the widespread use of drones in recent conflicts is drawing further {PRC} attention to drone warfare. {PRC} writings from the past four years demonstrate that the {PLA} is exploring the use of uncrewed systems and testing drone swarm technology for use in a possible invasion of Taiwan. In addition, the {PRC} is examining militaries’ use of drones and drone swarms to develop its own counter–drone swarm methods and technologies.},
