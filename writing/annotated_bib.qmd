Ukrainian forces plan around 106,000 drone missions monthly, detect and classify over 4,000 reconnaissance targets daily and 12,000 pieces of enemy equipment weekly, using information contributed by military personnel on over 600,000 enemy objects monthly via the Delta situational awareness system. Delta is establishing the first Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control system in modern warfare [@bondar_does_2024]. Delta aggregates data from heterogeneous sources from civilian and open source intelligence to military sensors and utilizes computer vision to generate insights. Using these insights, Delta allows for the coordination of mission planning and execution across all military branches, including drone operations. 

This study will analyze whether Taiwan can adapt Delta's software architecture for cross-strait defense, addressing what specific capabilities would enable effective drone coordination against amphibious invasion and how such a system would affect military balance as Taiwan looks to increase its drone arsenal. Taiwan faces fundamentally different strategic challenges than Ukraine, specifically defending against amphibious invasion across the 110-mile Taiwan Strait. The maritime setting, extended engagement ranges, limited operational windows due to weather, and concentration of invasion forces during strait crossings create distinct requirements that differ substantially from Ukraine's land-based operations.

Across 24 wargaming iterations, CSIS research documents that Chinese amphibious operations face challenges more difficult than the Normandy landings due to the Taiwan Strait's geographic characteristics [@cancian_first_2023]. The 110-mile strait width, limited viable landing beaches restricted to 14-20 locations, and operational windows constrained to April and October create natural defensive advantages that concentrate invasion forces into predictable kill zones. The wargaming concludes that even under optimistic Chinese assumptions, invasion fleets arrive "in shambles" when Taiwan employs integrated anti-ship capabilities, with modeling showing 138 Chinese ships destroyed across scenarios.

Exploiting these geographic advantages requires understanding how maritime operations reshape drone coordination software requirements. Maritime drone operations exhibit fundamentally different characteristics than land warfare, with Indo-Pacific distances requiring drones costing $50,000-$500,000 with ranges exceeding 100 kilometers, compared to Ukraine's $300-$1,000 first-person view drones with 10-40 kilometer ranges. It also requires coordination of heterogenous systems, and integrate with both Taiwanese and American systems. Stacie Pettyjohn and colleagues recommend the Taiwanese procurement and training for anti-ship drone boats, as well as short and mid-range drones to support the defense of Taiwan's coastline, as well as the American procurement of long range drones for kamikaze attacks and surveillance [@pettyjohn_drone_2024]. Coordination of heterogenous systems, and integration with both Taiwanese and American systems is a critical requirement for any Delta adaptation.

Any Delta adaptation must account for both the potential and limitations of opposing counter-drone systems. China has systematically absorbed Ukrainian lessons, undertaking aggressive counter-drone modernization integrating detection systems, electronic warfare capabilities, kinetic interceptors, and directed energy weapons [@ditter_prc_2025]. The PLA's layered counter-drone doctrine operates across four engagement zones, with long-range detection beyond 200 kilometers employing satellites and radar networks, mid-range electronic warfare at 50-200 kilometers using sophisticated jamming capabilities including J-16D electronic warfare aircraft, and short-range hard destruction at 5-50 kilometers deploying directed energy weapons such as high-power microwave systems and laser interceptors. However, recent exercises demonstrated only 40% hit rates against small drone swarms even using relatively dated systems against just 11-12 commercial drones, revealing critical vulnerabilities. Chinese military analyses acknowledge traditional air defenses struggle against small, agile, low-flying drone swarms, creating an exploitable weakness during amphibious operations when PLAN forces must maintain formation over extended crossings while simultaneously coordinating air defense, managing electromagnetic spectrum control, tracking hundreds of incoming threats, and conducting landing operations under fire.

These geographic, operational, and threat considerations establish the analytical framework for this investigation. This research will examine what software capabilities and architectural features a Delta-analogue command-and-control system would require to effectively coordinate autonomous drone operations in Taiwan Strait defense scenarios, and what strategic impact such a system would have on cross-strait military balance. The investigation will focus on technical adaptations necessary to translate Ukraine's land-based Delta system to Taiwan's maritime operational environment, particularly regarding targeting algorithms, navigation systems, and coordination protocols. The study will evaluate how extended engagement ranges, maritime target characteristics, and weather constraints alter software requirements, while assessing force multiplication effects Taiwan could achieve during critical conflict phases. The research will also analyze how Chinese counter-drone capabilities would constrain AI-enabled drone coordination effectiveness and examine strategic deterrence implications of Taiwan fielding Delta-equivalent capabilities.
