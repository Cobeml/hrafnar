Warfare is always changing. It is the fundamental human proving ground. The adept, strong, innovative, persuasive rise. It is about finding and utilizing the right tools at the right time. Today, the time is of AI enabled autonomy. Previous deep learning systems specialized very well but with the advent of large language models, humans now have access to programmatic general intelligence. Additionally, with fine-tuning techniques such as GRPO and other derivative methods, one can specialize the general intelligence that LLMs bring for tasks which require technical specificity, creating models which are both proficient and adaptive. These models enable for the first time, autonomous agents on the battlefield. This is not a possibility but an inevitability for the near term future of warfare. 
In conflicts in Ukraine and the middle east, the central nature of drone warfare is already on display. However, these drones autonomous capabilities are extremely limited. If a conflict were to break out over Taiwan. This would be the first conflict between parties with the technical capability and therefore military necessity to bring autonomy onto the battlefield. This will enable adaptable drone swarms operating with minimal human in the loop as to combat electronic warfare attempts.
