# Applications for the Project

## Getting Within Range: Launch Platform Strategies

### **Geographic Reality**

Taiwan is approximately 100 nautical miles (180km) from mainland China across the Taiwan Strait

### **Launch Platform Options**

**1. Island-Based Launch**

Taiwan should restrict drone swarms to island beach landing site approaches, as this provides superior targeting data compared to long-range operations

* **Advantages** : Small USVs can be launched from even the smallest ports, beaches, and coves on Taiwan or outlying islands, transported on trucks and deployed when needed for surprise
* **Defensive positioning** : Wait for Chinese forces to enter engagement range rather than attempting deep strikes
* **Key insight** : Taiwan need not "blot out the sun with drones" - the Hellscape only needs to destroy more invading ships than Chinese commanders can afford to lose

**2. Ship-Launched Drones**

USVs can be deployed from crewed ships like Taiwan's Yushan-class landing platform docks, each able to carry 20+ drone craft

**3. Pre-Positioned Assets**

Thousands of prepositioned air, sea and ground drones operating in tandem on Taiwan could turn the 100 nautical miles into a "hellscape" during amphibious operations

### **Range Requirements Based on Ukraine Lessons**

**Ukrainian Naval Drone Performance:**

The Magura V5 USV has a range of over 400 nautical miles (740km), cruising speed of 22 knots, top speed of 42 knots, with burst speeds up to 54 knots

Ukrainian sea drones have ranges up to 500 miles with 440-pound payloads

Ukrainian drones use Starlink and GPS for remote control, enabling operations at extended ranges with surveillance and logistics capabilities

**For Taiwan Scenario:**

* **Minimum effective range** : 50-100km to cover strait crossings
* **Optimal range** : 200-400km to engage blockading forces and provide operational flexibility
* **Endurance** : 12-24 hours for persistent operations

## Most Vulnerable Ship Types

### **Primary Targets (Highest Priority)**

**1. Amphibious Assault Ships**

Type 075 LHDs and Type 071 LPDs would conduct initial landings, with specialized bridging barges following to deliver second-wave forces

* **Vulnerability** : Large, slow-moving targets concentrated during landing operations
* **Mission criticality** : China has four amphibious combined arms brigades near Taiwan; losing these landing capabilities would cripple invasion plans
* **Drone effectiveness** : High - large radar cross-sections, predictable approach paths, concentrated defensive burden

**2. Civilian RO-RO Ferries (Dual-Use)**

China's Bo Hai Heng Tong ferry has vehicle cargo capacity almost three times that of a San Antonio-class LPD; China has access to 63+ civilian ROROs for military operations

* **Vulnerability** : Minimal defensive armament, not designed to resist attack
* **Strategic value** : These dual-use ships provide China with capacity to transport and land more troops than the US Navy
* **Drone effectiveness** : Extremely high - soft targets with devastating impact on invasion capacity

**3. Landing Craft and Amphibious Bridging Barges**

New specialized barges with 120+ meter road bridges designed to deliver tanks directly to coastal roads

* **Vulnerability** : Exposed during transit, limited point defense
* **Timing** : Most vulnerable during second-wave operations after initial landing
* **Drone effectiveness** : Very high - concentrated in predictable locations

**4. Support and Logistics Vessels**

* Replenishment oilers, hospital ships, command ships
* **Rationale** : Ukraine's focus on logistics disruption forced Russia's Black Sea Fleet into retreat

### **Secondary Targets**

**5. Smaller Combatants**

* Type 054A frigates, Type 056 corvettes
* **Lower priority** but still vulnerable to swarm attacks
* Provide escort for amphibious forces

**6. Coast Guard and Maritime Militia**

In quarantine scenarios, over three dozen CCG and MSA vessels plus dozens of maritime militia craft would be deployed

* **Psychological impact** : Attacking "civilian" vessels complicates China's gray-zone narrative

### **Least Vulnerable (Avoid or Secondary Priority)**

**Type 055/052D Destroyers:**

* Extensive layered defenses (detailed earlier)
* High ammunition capacity
* Advanced sensors and coordination
* **Recommendation** : Only target if isolated or after ammunition depletion

## Scout/ISR Roles for Drones

### **Critical ISR Functions**

**1. Early Warning and Tracking**

JUMP 20 drones offer 13+ hours of autonomous flight with 185km range for persistent maritime surveillance and detecting warship movements, landing craft, or troop concentrations

In Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine, drones were most effective as part of ground-based fires complexes, turning unguided artillery into precision weapons

**2. Target Acquisition for Fires**

Drones provide reconnaissance and targeting information for coastal defense cruise missiles, artillery, and mobile strike systems

Taiwan is developing map-based software to accelerate information sharing between drones and artillery units for rapid kill chains

**3. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA)**

Ukraine paired USVs with UAV reconnaissance to create "dilemma cascade" - multiple overlapping threats that overwhelm defenses

**4. Communications Relay**

* Mesh networking between drone swarms
* Relay communications in EW-degraded environments
* Coordinate multi-axis attacks

**5. Decoy Operations**

USVs can serve as mobile decoys, drawing attention away from more valuable missile and drone assets

### **Hybrid Platforms**

**Scout-Strike Integration:**

Ukraine's Magura V5 drones shot down Russian Mi-8 helicopters with heat-seeking missiles - first known case of naval drones hitting aircraft

Ukrainian USVs deployed kamikaze aerial drones from the Black Sea to target Russian air defense systems - turning naval drones into carrier platforms

 **Key Design Principle** : Every drone should have dual-use ISR capability, even if primary mission is kinetic strike

## Non-Navy Scenarios of Interest

### **1. Blockade/Quarantine Operations**

China could deploy CCG and MSA vessels to enforce "enhanced customs inspections" while claiming it's domestic law enforcement, not a military blockade

**Drone Applications:**

* Monitor and document blockade enforcement
* Harass coast guard vessels to disrupt operations
* Force China to deploy military assets, escalating situation
* Target civilian shipping commandeered for military use

### **2. Outlying Island Defense**

Platforms like the Altius-600 and C-100 could support Taiwanese forces defending Taiwan-controlled islands near the Chinese mainland

* Kinmen, Matsu, Pratas Islands
* China could seize outlying Taiwanese islands as lower-risk option than full invasion
* Drone swarms from these islands as forward outposts

### **3. Anti-Air Defense Suppression**

China's PLA fielded ASN-301 anti-radiation loitering munitions, characterized as "radar killers" for targeting enemy radio and communications stations

**Taiwan Counter-Application:**

* Target Chinese mobile SAM systems
* Suppress radar installations
* Create air defense gaps for manned strikes

### **4. Port and Infrastructure Attacks**

**Ukraine Model:**

Ukraine's Sea Baby drones struck port city of Novorossiysk and damaged the Kerch Bridge, forcing temporary closures of key supply routes

Russia struck Ukraine's offshore Tavrida rig platform, reportedly serving as docking/refueling station for Ukrainian sea drones

**Taiwan Applications:**

* Attack Chinese embarkation ports (Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo)
* Target loading facilities before invasion force deploys
* Pre-emptive strikes on concentrations

### **5. Underwater/Mine Warfare**

China developing AJX002 extra-large underwater drones for mine-laying, deep-water operations, and infrastructure sabotage

**Taiwan Counter-Options:**

* UUVs for defensive mine-laying
* Anti-submarine reconnaissance
* Cable/pipeline monitoring

### **6. Electronic Warfare and Cyber Operations**

China's Strategic Support Force fields UAVs for electronic warfare missions, with swarms used for reconnaissance, jamming, and assault

**Drone-EW Integration:**

* Altius-600 can perform surveillance, reconnaissance, counterintelligence, communications, and cyber warfare missions
* Jamming platforms to disrupt Chinese command and control
* GPS/communications denial

### **7. Swarm vs. Swarm Combat**

China exhibits UAV swarm combat systems with swarms for reconnaissance, jamming, and "swarm assault"

"Can we put a 100 drone swarm vs this 50 drone swarm?" - the kinetic aspect of counter-drone operations

 **Tactical consideration** : Your drones may face Chinese counter-swarms, requiring:

* Air-to-air capable drones
* Defensive swarm behaviors
* Counter-jamming capabilities

## Key Strategic Insights for Hrafnar

### **Production and Attrition**

Ukraine loses ~10,000 drones per month; Taiwan and Beijing would "churn through thousands of UAVs on a daily, if not hourly, basis" in opening volleys

Taiwan's recent purchase of 291 Altius-600M, 685 Switchblade, and 4 MQ-9B drones would sustain just 4-5 volleys against the PLA

 **Implication** : Ukraine claims capability to manufacture 50 Magura V5 USVs per month at $250,000-$300,000 each

### **Asymmetric Cost Advantage**

Magura V5 USVs destroyed 8 Russian warships and damaged 6 more in first year, causing over $500 million in damages

* Cost ratio heavily favors defender
* Forces attacker to expend expensive interceptors on cheap drones

### **Electronic Warfare Reality**

Russian Katran USV "lacks satellite communication capabilities unlike Ukrainian drones with Starlink, instead relying on radio channels, limiting operational range and making it susceptible to EW"

 **Critical** : Your AI autonomy approach directly addresses this weakness

### **Timing and Deterrence**

Taiwan's drone capabilities expected to peak by 2025-2026, creating a narrowing window where China's traditional military advantages can still decisively overwhelm swarm defenses

The "reveal" of Pentagon's Replicator initiative forced PLA planners to rethink operations against Taiwan

 **Deterrence value** : Visible capability affects adversary planning
